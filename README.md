Harmony is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). We aim to stay as close to vanilla SS14 as possible, while adding cosmetic changes that make Harmony our home, and features that enable MRP (medium roleplay) playstyle.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.
